Today, I will introduce to you the term "Lamp Stack".

A lamp stack is an open source software which could be used for web application development. However, setting a lamp stack comes with many nessecary components.

1. An operating system
2. A web server
3. A database
4. A programming language

The four components that I used to create a lamp stack were linux, apache, mySQL, and PHP.

Linux is the main component of the lamp stack because it is the operating system which allows you to perform any of the operating. Without an operating system like linux, you won't be able to begin the first step.

Apache is the HTTP web server that helps the operating system perform the actions. What I mean by this is, apache will allow requests to come in and out and carry information through the internet.

mySQL is the type of language that is reccomended becuase it is a very strong performing query. A query is what allows you to store information in your database.

PHP is the programming language that basically wraps everything up and allows your website to function properly. The PHP commands are what a user to encounter and operate on the website.

The importance of lamp stacks are very significant because it allows users to use free and open source softwares to create and customize a secure and stable platform.
