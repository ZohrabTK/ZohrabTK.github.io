In today's blog I will talk about the topic of packet configuration which is a very useful and important tool to inherit in today's world as a system administrator. Packet configuration is the process of importing data in entries such as tables in order for your customer or customer to receieve your information. There are also permissions that are required in order to do this. First, the user who will export the data needs to have read effective permissions. Second, the user who will import the data will need to have insert and modify permissions.

To create these packet configurations, you will need to choose a new action. Then, you will get tables and get package tables in order to select the tables field and add tables to the package. Then you can select a table and then from there you can adjust the fields with your data. You can filter your dataset as well, in order to review your dataset.

You can also customize these packages in ways that you would like. For example, adding an area with a name field. Or you can even add groups so you can group data with a specific class.

After doing such things, you can export this data and it will help with a more signifcant system administration to the company. This is a very useful tool to learn and will allow you to save time, budget, and even errors.
