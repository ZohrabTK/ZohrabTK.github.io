In today's blog I will introduce and talk about the basics of github actions. Github actions are useful for when you want to build a container, deploy a web service, or automate a welcome for new users to open your open source projects. The actions that will help you do these various actions are with events such as push, issue creation, or a new release.

These actions are basically foundations and building blocks for your end result of a working product. You can either create the actions or use community created actions.

These workflows can be created with major operating systems, matrix builds, and in any language. Your projects can be built and ran directly on a vm or inside a container. To test your workflows, you can use matrix workflows so it tests multiple at a time to save you time. The best part about all of this is that github actions supports any language such as java, ruby, and even python.

You will also be able to see live logs of your workflow which will help you understand failures and operations of each certain segment. If you are having trouble and encountering too many errors, you can either decide to fix them or use one of the millions of open source libraries that are available on Github created by the community.
