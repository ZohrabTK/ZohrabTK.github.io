In today's blog I will introduce the topic of CodeDeploy that is an AWS service for thousands of users daily. AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that computes services and allows you to rapidly release new features. This helps users avoid downtime during application deployment and updates your applications without any issues. You can also use CodeDeploy to automatically automate so you don't need to do anything manually. 

There are many benefits to CodeDeploy such as...

Automated Deployments - No need for manually deployments that will cause human error. Automatic deployments will also save time and produce better production environments.

Minimize downtime - Allows for application availability by tracking application health according to configurable rules.

Centralized Control - Allows for tracking the status of your application deployments through the management console or CLI. You also receive a detailed report so you can gather data about the deployment process.
