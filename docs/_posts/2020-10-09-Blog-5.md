In today's blog, I will be introducing to you the creation of a dockerfile and it's use of copying scripts and displaying a web application. For today's example I will be using the affinity web application.

Firstly, you want to create a text file in order to store your commands you wish to run.

Some of these commands are...
1. RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get -y upgrade (Make sure you add -y to prompt the system to say 'yes' to running the command)
2. RUN apt-get install -y php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql php7.2-cli php7.2-curl php7.2-gd php7.2-mbstring php7.2-mysql php7.2-xml php-xml
3. RUN git clone https://github.com/csuntechlab/affinity.git /var/www/html/affinity 

These are just some of the key commands that are needed in order to create a successful Dockerfile that will run the web application.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you have listed all your commands in your file, you will want to create it with the name of the image.

Enter the following commands in order...
1. docker build -t <NAME OF IMAGE> (The image can be named anything)
2. docker run -it <NAME OF IMAGE> /bin/bash
3. docker run -rm -it <NAME OF IMAGE> /bin/bash
4. docker start <name of container>
5. docker exec -it <name of container> bash

From these five commands, you will able to construct and build the dockerfile and container with the image that contains all of the commands. After this is created, you can go to localhost and see the visual web application.
