What is Ansible?

Ansible is a tool that is used for cross-platform software support. Some things that you can use ansible for are...

1. Application deployment
2. Updates on workstations and servers
3. Cloud provisioning
4. Configuration management
5. Intra-service orchestration.

Ansible will allow users to configure multiple networks at once and doesn't require much skill to do so, so it is very user friendly. Everything you do is done by writing simple scripts.
