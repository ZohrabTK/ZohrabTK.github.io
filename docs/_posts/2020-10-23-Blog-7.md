In this blog, I will introduce the concept of using HTML code to set up a webpage. The reason why HTML is so useful is becuase it is very easy to use and straightforward. Some types of webpages that you could create using HTML could be a resume, a diary, or even a news article. 

If you're wondering what you need to start using HTML, it's as simple as a notepad and your browser.

Before I show any examples, I will introduce some basics about HTML code.

The first thing you want to get familiar with is an element. A tag is basically a something you want to create in "<>", such as <img> which will help you display an image on your website. The "<>" are also known as tags.

Next, you want to understand attributes, which are basically adjectives that help you support your element. So for our image example, you can add width and length attributes to set the size of the image.

This is what it would look like...

Combination of a <img> source tag such as "img_dog.jpg", followed by the width and height equally to the pixel size.

This would display an image of a dog, with a width of 500 and height of 600 pixels.

There are also various other elements which could be anything from paragraphs (<p>), headers (<h>), and even lists (<ul>). To edit your paragraphs, your headers could be anything from <h1> to <h5> which adjusts your font from larger to smaller. You could also add these sizes to your list as well.
 
By combining these basic elements, you'll be able to display a simple website in your browser. It does get indeed get more in depth and advanced, which is why HTML is so useful!
