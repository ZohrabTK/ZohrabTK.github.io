This blog will be all about the installion process of Jekyll for MacOS.

To get started, it is important to know the use of Jekyll. 

Rather than using databases, Jekyll allows the user to take content and use a markdown template to produce a ready to use, static website. This website is served by web servers such as Apache HTTP Server.

The first step you have to do is install ruby. Ruby is a programming language similar to python that alows the user to build web applications.

To get Ruby at its latest version, you will need to install it with Homebrew. Homebrew is a program that lets you install software on MacOS in a much simpler way.

To install ruby with homebrew, enter these commands in order:
1. /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
2. brew install ruby
3. ruby -v (To confirm you have a running version of ruby)

Now that you have ruby, you will need to install jekyll.

To install jekyll follow this command:
1. gem install bundler jekyll

This will install jekyll on your system and you will be ready it towards producing a static website. Without Jekyll, this blog wouldn't have been able to be created on github.
