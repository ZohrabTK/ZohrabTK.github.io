Today I will introduce the platform "Docker".

Docker is a very useful open platform tool to learn in today's day and age because it allows users to develop, ship, and run applications quickly. The reason why it is much quicker to use docker is because you can treat your infrastructure the same as your applications which reduces time spent between writing your code and running it.

Some key components docker provides the user with:

1. Develop your application and componenents using containers. 
2. Using your container to test your applications.
3. Setting your application to perform into your production environment which is your container or service.

Docker allows you to use a program called "daemon" which is a long-running background process that manages your containers on a single host. This daemon is commanded by a rest api which helps you perform certain tasks. This is all done by using the command line interface that docker provides.

The reason why you would to get familiar with docker is because it is very helpful service for communicating with others. An example of this would be writing and sharing code with colleagues using your docker containers. There are permissions that may grant these colleagues to collectively work and fix certain problems that will eventually lead to a running application.
