In today's blog I will be introducing the importance of a standard language which is known as structured query language (SQL).

SQL is very useful in today's world computer information technology because you can do various things such as:

1. Create queries against a database
2. Update records in a database
3. Retrieve data from a database
4. Create a new database
5. Insert records in a database

Not only is it useful for a computer information technology field, but also many others such as hospitals and businesses.

SQL is really straightforward and easy to learn compared to the other languages such as Java, C++, python, etc. The reason why is because it's a standard programming language that uses easy functions and commands to create and design index structures.

With jobs in high demand for people with experience in SQL, some of the tasks you may have are:

- Database administrator: Creating and storing data in a database in a efficient manner. This will allow users to retrieve important information used to complete certain tasks. An example of this would be an accountant.

- Data Scientist: A data scientiest would use SQL to gather information and be able to structure it in a way to show patterns and trends. For this to be possible, they would need to implement a managable way of handling large amounts of data in the most simplest way.
